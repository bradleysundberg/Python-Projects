# Basic Python Projects
These are basic projects written in Python. They use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.

# Classes
This project functions as a university database. It stores and displays information about different schools.

# Django Checkbook Project
This project functions as a checkbook. It saves and displays information related to deposits and withdrawals.

# Database
This project filters a list of filenames and stores .txt files in a database, then displays the results. Itâ€™s a basic example of database interaction and file type filtering.

# Nice or Mean
The game greets the player, asks for their name, and then presents a series of scenarios where "a stranger approaches you for a conversation." Each time, you must choose whether to be nice (N) or mean (M). Your choices are tracked with "nice" and "mean" counters.

# Abstraction
This project uses abstraction in Python to define a common interface for subclasses (here, all animals must have a make_sound() method). It provides a concrete implementation with the Dog class. It then creates a dog and prints information about it using both the abstract and regular methods.

# Encapsulation
This file defines a simple BankAccount class in Python to demonstrate the concept of encapsulation.

# File Transfer
This is a utility app for regularly copying recently modified files from one folder to another, using a simple GUI.
